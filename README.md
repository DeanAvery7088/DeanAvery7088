### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

After a several year hiatus, I'm working to re-establish a career in software development.  I'm interested in the areas of game development, blockchain, and AI.  I'm currently spending time working on a Harvard course developing in Lua and C# as well as taking courses through Udemy.
